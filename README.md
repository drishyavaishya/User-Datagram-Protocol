   "https://github.com/username/repo.git", you can run the command "git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git" in your terminal to clone the repository, and      
   you're all set to start.

All about Its Working!

1) As you navigate through the home page, you will get some basic information about UDP Protocol. There is a button “Start Demo” which will take you to demo page.

2) The user will have to behave like a UDP and fill the required information in the UDP Header. 

3) The user will be provided with a data packet that needs to be sent to given Destination Port. The user will also be provided with available ports which he/she can      use as source Port.

4) The user will have to fill the Source Port, Destination Port and the length in the UDP Header.

5) The “Send Packet” button verifies the filled information. If the user has filled wrong information then the website will ask the user to try again. If the user has    filled the correct information then  the packet will be sent to the given Destination Port and It will wait for response from the Destination Port.

6) After the response arrives, the user has to again behave like UDP and breakdown the arrived UDP Header.

7) The User has to fill the Destination Port and the Data Length. The “verify Breakdown” button verifies the filled information. If the fill information is incorrect ,    the website asks the user to Try Again. If the filled information is correct, then a link will be established between Source Port and Destination Port. The user        will be asked to Chat Again.

8) There is a “History log” which maintains the history of activities happened.

9) The “Reset” button in the upper right corner will reset the website.
